Rules for writing man pages
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* put two single quotes around an option name like ``--help``.

* put two single quotes with colon around f ``field:``.

* put double quotes an example of command line, option usage like
  "--langdef=MyLang" and referring a section.

* use two asterisks for newly introduced conceptual **word** and reserved
  words. The reserved words are

  * "default" in --langmap

* use asterisks for option parameter like *LANG* in --kind-<LANG> option.

Testing and verification
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* pick reserved words

  - "default"
  - "all"

* verify whether + and - can be used as part of language names:

  --langmap
	languages like C++ and/or Objective-C can be specified.

  --languages
	languages like C++ and/or Objective-C can be specified.

* TODO

  - strcasecmp must be used when comparing the name of languages.
